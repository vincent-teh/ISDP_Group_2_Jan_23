### Mission Statement
Temperature control in a remote plant has malfunctioned due to a faulty sensor.  An IoT-based Service Module (ISM) will be developed to navigate autonomously to the remote plant, by searching for objects of certain shapes for navigation. Upon reaching the plant, the ISM will take over the faulty temperature control, through its on-board temperature sensor and utilizing the plant’s heating unit. The ISM’s web-cam and temperature sensor, and the plant’s heater are all IoT-enabled. Navigation decisions and temperature control algorithm are performed on the base station laptop, communicating with the ISM’s control board, sensor and actuator.
